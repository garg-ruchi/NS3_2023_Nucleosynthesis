    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This Jupyter notebook contains the Thursday's activity of the [NS3 Summer School](https://frib.msu.edu/public/frib-outreach/ns3.html). Two main topics will be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Nuclear masses, binding energies and the impact of shell closures.\n",
    " 2. The role of nuclear masses in the r-process path.\n",
    " \n",
    "Throughout each section you will find questions and exercises (marked in red). Some of those are optional, and we suggest the groups to keep them for last.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If at some point you mess up something irreversibly, don't worry! Just click again in the [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/garg-ruchi/NS3_2023_Nucleosynthesis/master?labpath=notebook%2Fmasses.ipynb) and start a fresh notebook.\n",
    " - If you need an empty Jupyter notebook, click on `File < New Notebook < Python 3`. \n",
    " - You can run all the cells in the notebook by clicking  `Cells < Run all` in the menu above. It is convenient if you want to clean your variables after going back and forth between different cells.\n",

    "- We highly recomend the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula) on liquid drop model, which contains an extensive and complete discussion about this topic.\n",
    "- For those of you interested in deeper discussion about the physics contents of the liquid drop model parametrization, there is a recent paper on [Statistical aspects of nuclear mass models](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6471/ab907c) by V.

    " * There is a volume term $a_1A$ proportional with the number of nucleons (the energy is also an extensive quantity). When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    " * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. \n",
    "\n",
    " * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflects the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions."
